# Life Choice Game

An interactive text-based adventure game written in Python.  
You play as yourself, following a one rule:  
*Never answer with "no".*

Depending on your choices, you’ll experience different story paths and multiple endings — some lighthearted, some dark.

## Features:                                          
* Multiple decision branches and outcomes.
* Choices affect the story in surprising ways.
* Hidden tests to check if you follow the rule.
* Fun, surreal endings
